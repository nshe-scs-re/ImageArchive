     How to Run ML_initialize.py
=====================================

1. Install Required Python Packages

If you haven't already, set up your Python environment.

Install the required libraries:
    pip install torch torchvision pillow tqdm pymssql

To use a GPU, install a GPU-enabled version of PyTorch.
See install options at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

2. Update Database Settings

Open the file: db_connect.py

Edit the database connection in the connect_to_database() function:

Lines 5â€“11:
    conn = pymssql.connect(
        server='',
        user='',
        password='',
        database='',
        port=
    )

Update the values for server, user, password, database, and port.


3. Update Paths in ML_initialize.py

Open the file: ML_initialize.py

Line 65:
    model_path = "best_model.pth"
Change this to your actual model file path.

Line 99:
    base_path = "/"
Change this to the folder where your images are stored.


4. Ensure Database is Running

5. Run the Script

Run the script with:
    python3 ML_initialize.py

The script will:
- Connect to your database
- Load the model
- Run predictions on all image paths
- Save predictions and confidence scores into the database

If no GPU is available, the script will continue with the CPU.
