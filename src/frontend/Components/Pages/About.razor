    <h1>About the Image Archive Project</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Image Archive Project – a dedicated platform aimed at empowering researchers, environmentalists, and field science professionals with efficient access to a vast collection of environmental imagery data. Developed by a team of passionate students from the University of Nevada, Reno, this project addresses the unique challenges of accessing, organizing, and analyzing large-scale image data collected across Nevada's scientific field stations.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to bridge the gap between data collection and data utilization by providing a centralized, accessible, and user-friendly image repository platform. In an era where the volume of data is exploding, especially within environmental and field sciences, researchers face the challenge of accessing specific datasets from fragmented storage systems. This platform aims to simplify data retrieval, enhance research productivity, and foster collaboration across interdisciplinary teams.
        </p>
